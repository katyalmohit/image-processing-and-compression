# image-processing-and-compression
This project consists of image processing techniques like image compression, color inversion, RGB to grayscale and mirroring.

# Description
* This project can be used to compress image whether in grayscale or in RGB format.
* It can be used to invert color of the image.
* Depending upon the need of compression, user can choose the slider to manipulate the compression ratio.
* It is built using the Singular Value Decomposition and concepts of linear algebra, as it is efficient to implement these techiniques.
* However, we faced some difficulties while creating the robust front-end desgin for the user.

# How to Install and Run the Project
* If you have the MATLAB installed in your system you can directly download/clone and use this repo.
* However, if you are using the online version of MATLAB then follow these steps:
  1. Download/Clone the repo.
  2. Open the online version of MATLAB.
  3. Open the MATLAB drive.
  4. Upload the downloaded/cloned folder here.
  5. Open the MATLAB app designer.
  6. Now, you can use the project same as your local projects.

# How to Use the Project
* After spawing the necessary files/folder on you local/cloud version of MATLAB you can use our project.
* When you click on run button, it will show a GUI where you can deploy any photo for image processing operations.
* For changing the compression ration you can use the slider.
* For other functionalities, you can use the buttons.
* If you wish the exit the program, either you can click of the exit button at the bottom right corner or you can stop the program.
